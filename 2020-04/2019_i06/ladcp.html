<p>LADCP was collected during full depth CTD casts at all stations by Benjamin Musci.
Quality control, preliminary processing, and post-processing for horizontal and vertical velocity was made on board by Benjamin Musci.
Approximately every 3 casts data was sent to Andreas Thurnherr for further QC.</p>
<div class="section" id="ladcp-system-configuration">
<h2>LADCP system configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#ladcp-system-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An upward-looking (UL) and a downward-looking (DL) ADCP, and a rechargeable battery, were affixed to the rosette using custom brackets (Figure 1 and 2).
The UL instrument was positioned ~5 inches over the top rosette ring while the DL instrument was positioned between Niskin bottles 4 and 6 and affixed through the brackets to one of the rosette bottom cross bars. The transducers on the DL were about 5 inches above the bottom ring of the rosette.</p>
<p>An external magnetometer/accelerometer package (independent measurement package; IMP) was installed inside the Teledyne RDI WHM300 UL ADCP (SN: 12734) to collect additional pitch, roll and heading data.
A star cable was used to connect both UL and DL ADCPs to the battery and deck/connection cables.</p>
<p>While on deck, two communications and one power cable ran from the aft wet lab to the staging bay where the CTD package rested on a pallet while in transit between stations.
One of the power cables connected the battery to a battery charger while the second power cable connected the ADCPs through the star cable to a power supply.
The communications cable connected the ADCPS to a MAC computer via a USB serial adapter which was used for communications to the instrument and data download.
The LADCP acquisitions computer clock was synced to the master clock via the ship network system and set to UTC.</p>
<p>Three different ADCP instruments were used during the course of the cruise, two of which were always deployed on the Rosette.
The initial set-up consisted of the Teledyne RDI WHM150 (S/N:24544) as DL and a Teledyne RDI WHM300 (S/N:12734) as the UL. An alternative UL, another Teledyne RDI WHM300 (S/N:24477), was also provided and would be used heavily.
Two battery packages were used during the course of the cruise, a Deepsea Power and Light SB 48 V/16 A (S/N: 01283) and another Deepsea Power and Light SB 48 V/16 A (S/N: N/A).
All instruments were set up to record velocity data with 8 m bins and zero blanking distance.
Staggered pinging was used to avoid previous ping interference.</p>

<div class="section" id="problems-setup-changes">
<h2>Problems/Setup changes<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-setup-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Several issues arose during the course of the cruise, with some compromising data quality, although data is available for all casts on the cruise. Independent issues concerning the CTD also occurred, which negatively affected LADCP data quality for numerous casts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Station 1: Due to DL vertical velocity data issues during the test cast, the primary UL (SN:12734) was swapped with the alternative UL (SN: 24477). The vertical velocity residuals in the DL were correlated with distance from the instrument, and DC-DC converter in the Ras-Pi in the UL was thought to be the culprit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No IMP for stations 1-9.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Station 2: The CTD lost power at some point during the bottom portion of the downcast. It was restarted during the cast, so 2 CTD (.cnv) files were created, which must be stitched together manually for processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 5: “Long-ish gap” (on the order of 10’s of seconds) warnings became more frequent on stations 1-4, so UL was switched to master role, with DL as slave. CTD froze during initial cast, so cast was aborted and restarted. CTD cast number is 00502.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 5-7: Master and slave ADCP roles were switched, but not the file naming format. Thus for casts 005-00 master was still saved as DL, despite it being UL data. I.e. files such as 005DL000.000 are actually 005UL000.000, and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 8: Master and slave roles swapped back to original configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 10: Vertical velocity quality issues in DL continuing. Rules out that problem is caused by UL, so switched back to primary UL with IMP/ras-pi for this cast. UL is still slave. Note, fortunately it appears that because the scattering environment for 1-9 is good, satisfactory vertical velocity data can be produced from the UL only.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 15: Data download/endladcp2 command failed. Each ADCP lost power momentarily during different parts of the cast, which caused data download issues. No data was lost, but data files with actual data are 015UL001.000 and 015DL000.000.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 16: Master slave roles switched in attempt to remedy donwload issues in 015. Master is UL.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 017: Swapped out faulty deck cable. No data lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 018: CTD pressure readings became erroneous during cast, particularly near the surface. CTD transmission issues as well cause issues in vertical velocity processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 019: Swapped CTDs prior to this cast (from fish 0830 to 0914). Pressure readings are still wrong near the surface, particularly at beginning and end of cast. May not be able to trust fidelity of pressure data for casts up until this point (1-19). Particularly stations 001, 002, 004, 005, 009, 010, 011, 014, 018, 019 show pressure problems at surface. Note that pressure surface anomalies should not greatly affect ADCP data quality because of LADCP surface detection problems near the surface anyway (due to sidelobe and vessel interference). The main effect of these pressure anomalies to this point seems to cause gaps in the vertical velocity profiles. Although the following stations may show anomalies for pressure at depth 006, 007, 008, 012, 013, 015, 016, 017.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 20-27: Swapped to third CTD (from ODF 0914 to UW 0057) due to continued pressure and data transmission problems. Pressure data seems ok, but data transmission problems cause time lag issues in the vertical velocity processing. Particularly for the downcast.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 20-39: CTD transmission problems continue. They do not seem to contaminate the horizontal velocity data, but they cause significant time lag editing issues in vertical velocity and make some data potentially unusable.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 25: Changed CTD termination, transmission problems remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 28: LADCPs momentarily lost power before cast, so data is in <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>001.000 files and not <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>000.000 files. No data lost. Large inversion residuals for the DL, but solution may be usable.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 29: DL continues to produce poor data. DL seems to have to performed especially poorly in this station, as evidenced by the inversion residuals. DL data in this run may be unusable. LADCPs momentarily lost power before cast, so data is in <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">*</span></a>001.000 files and not <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>000.000 files. No data lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 31: Excessive CTD transmission problems on this casts cause LEDO_IX processing to fail, as it cannot solve for time lag. No velocity profile could be generated. Not clear if this data will be usable. LADCPs momentarily power before cast, so data is in <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">*</span></a>001.000 files and not <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">*</span></a>000.000 files.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 32-33: LADCPs lost power during cast, so data is in <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">*</span></a>001.000 files and not <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">*</span></a>000.000 files. Data was not collected until ~700m into donwcast for both 032 and 033. 033 seems to have only momentarily lost power. Additionally, CTD transmission problems here likely causing time lag offsets in horizontal velocity. Likely the cause of failed time lag in 031 as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Station Test Cast2 - 903: Because of continued issues with the vertical velocity from the DL (high error and depth correlated residuals, stations 001-034) the WHM150 (S/N:24544) DL was swapped with the WHM300 (S/N:24477) and the new WHM300 was set as the master. This immediately solved the vertical velocity DL data issues. Would have been switched sooner but weather and CTD troubleshooting prevented it. Although, LADCPs momentarily lost power before cast, so data is in <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">*</span></a>001.000 files and not 000.000 files. No data lost. This test cast was completed after station 034 to test CTD troubleshooting. Prior to cast CTD was switched from 0057 to 0830. Transmission problems remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 35: CTD swapped back to UW 0057 from 0830, and this configuration remained for rest of cruise. Swapped to back up battery Deepsea Power and Light SB 48 V/16 A (S/N: 01283), as had determined that battery on the rosette was causing the data partitioning problems in stations 033,032,031,028, and 027.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 36-37: CTD transmission problems cause vertical vel time lag editing to remove large number of samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 40: CTD transmission problems resolved before this cast. Sea cable was being pinched under impulsive loads, causing transmission problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 42: Large towing velocities near the surface due to weather and strong currents cause disagreements in velocity data in the upper 800m or so.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 44: Large towing velocities near the surface due to weather and strong currents cause some disagreement in velocity data. CTD transmission issues returned as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Station 51: Winch wire began to fray during upcast. Took 2-2.5 hours to repair and so CTD was stationary at about 3000m during that process. Then for remainder of upcast, rosette was not stopped and bottles fired on the fly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DCP programming and data acquisition were carried out by Benjamin Musci using the LDEO Acquire software running on a MAC computer.
Prior to each cast, the corresponding command files were sent to both the UL and DL ADCPs, the ADCPS were switched to battery power, communications were then terminated, deck cables disconnected and all connections were secured and sealed with dummy plugs.
After the rosette was brought back up on desk following a cast, the communication and power cables were connected to the MAC computer.
Data acquisition were terminated and files were downloaded with the corresponding command using the Acquire software.
The battery was disconnected from the star cable and connected to a charger via a deck cable running from the staging bay to the wet lab.
The battery remained connected to the charger between stations.
The battery pack was periodically vented manually to prevent pressure build up. The second battery (S/N: 01283) was vented more frequently as the gas build up during charging caused large bubbles.
Log files were kept for each cast with LADCP and CTD information to ensure all steps were made properly.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-processing-and-quality-control">
<h2>Data Processing and Quality Control<a class="headerlink" href="#data-processing-and-quality-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ADCP data was processed daily by B. Musci using the Matlab-based LDEO LADCP processing software version IX (1).
Processing warnings and figures created through the software were reviewed for signs of anomalies such as rosette rotation and tilt, biased shear, agreement between LADCP and SADCP velocities, beam strength and range and ADCP distance to the sea bottom.
Data was sent to Andreas Thurnherr every 3 stations or when questionable profiles were observed.</p>
<p>Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the preliminary results of zonal and meridional velocities for all the available stations. The stations of the cruise were split up into a North and South portion, due to the medical evacuation that caused the abandonment of the planned science program at 50S. After evacuation a portion of the planned Northern stations were completed. 45 stations were completed in the Southern portion of the cruise and the final 10 in the Northern portion. The resolution of the Northern portion was compromised because of this.
Maximum values reach up ~65 cm/s in the upper ~1000m during the southern portion, and ~120 cm/s in the upper ~200m during the northern portion.
There is a relatively strong upper ocean current at ~57 S, and an equally strong current at depth around ~59 S in the southern portion. In the northern portion there is an extremely strong current at ~33 S.
Further QC and post-processing of horizontal and vertical velocities at all available stations will be done by Andreas Thurnherr at LDEO post-cruise.</p>
