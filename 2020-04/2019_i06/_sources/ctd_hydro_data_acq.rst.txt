CTDO and Bottle Data Acquisition
--------------------------------

The CTD data acquisition system consisted of an SBE-11+ (V2) deck unit and a networked generic PC workstation running Windows 7.
SBE SeaSave7 v.7.26.1.8 software was used for data acquisition and to close bottles on the rosette.

CTD deployments were initiated by the console watch operators (CWO) after the ship had stopped on station.
The watch maintained a CTD Cast logs for each attempted cast containing a description of each deployment event.

Once the deck watch had deployed the rosette, the winch operator would lower it to 20 meters.
The CTD sensor pumps were configured to start 10 seconds after the primary conductivity cell reports salt water in the cell.
The CWO checked the CTD data for proper sensor operation, waited for sensors to stabilize, and instructed the winch operator to bring the package to the surface in good weather or no more than 5 meters in high seas.
The winch was then instructed to lower the package to the initial target wire-out at no more than 30m/min to 100m and no more than 60m/min after 100m depending on sea-cable tension and the sea state.

The CWO monitored the progress of the deployment and quality of the CTD data through interactive graphics and operational displays.
The altimeter channel, CTD pressure, wire-out and center multi-beam depth were all monitored to determine the distance of the package from the bottom.
The winch was directed to slow decent rate to 40m/min 100m from the bottom and 20m/min 30m from the bottom.
The bottom of the CTD cast was usually to within 10-20 meters of the bottom determined by altimeter data.
For each up-cast, the winch operator was directed to stop the winch at up to 36 predetermined sampling pressures.
These standard depths were staggered every station using 3 sampling schemes.
The CTD CWO waited 30 seconds prior to tripping sample bottles, to ensure package shed wake had dissipated.
An additional 15 seconds elapsed before moving to the next consecutive trip depth, which allowed for the SBE35RT to record bottle trip temperature averaged from 14 samples.

After the last bottle was closed, the CWO directed winch to recover the rosette.
Once the rosette was out of the water and on deck, the CWO terminated the data acquisition, turned off the deck unit and assisted with rosette sampling.

Additionally, the watch created a sample log for the deployment which would be later used to record the depths bottles were tripped and correspondence between rosette bottles and analytical samples drawn.

Normally the CTD sensors were rinsed after each station using a fresh water tap connected to Tygon tubing.
The tubing was left on the CTD between casts, with the temperature and conductivity sensors immersed in fresh or salt water depending on ambient air temperatures.

Each bottle on the rosette had a unique serial number, independent of the bottle position on the rosette.
Sampling for specific programs were outlined on sample log sheets prior to cast recovery or at the time of collection.
The bottles and rosette were examined before samples were drawn.
Any abnormalities were noted on the sample log, stored in the cruise database and reported in the APPENDIX.

CTDO Data Processing
--------------------

Shipboard CTD data processing was performed after deployment using SIO/ODF python CTD processing software v. 0.1.
CTD acquisition data were copied onto a OS X system, and then processed.
CTD data at bottle trips were extracted, and a 2-decibar down-cast pressure series created.
The pressure series data set was submitted for CTD data distribution after corrections outlined in the following sections were applied.

A total of |NSTA| CTD stations were occupied including one test station.
A total of |TCST| |PACK| casts were completed.

CTD data were examined at the completion of each deployment for clean corrected sensor response and any calibration shifts.
As bottle salinity and oxygen results became available, they were used to refine shipboard conductivity and oxygen sensor calibrations.

Temperature, salinity and dissolved |O2| comparisons were made between down and up casts as well as between groups of adjacent deployments.
Vertical sections of measured and derived properties from sensor data were checked for consistency.

A number of issues were encountered during |CRS| that directly impacted CTD analysis.
Issues that directly impacted bottle closures, such as slipping guide rings, were detailed in the Underwater Sampling Package section of this report.
Temperature, conductivity and oxygen analytical sensor issues are detailed in the following respective sections.

Sensor Problems
---------------

Throughout the cruise, there were many problems with the CTDO sensors, leading to CTD downcast data to be flagged questionable.
SBE43 oxygen sensors were slightly noisy for most of the cruise, however there were a few notable casts that contained extremely noisy data.
Stations 7 and 34 are shown as examples.

  Station 7

.. figure:: /images/ctd_hydro_data_acq/stn_34_bad_oxy.*

  Station 34

Several stations also had a combination of the conductivity, temperature, and oxygen sensors producing spikes and questionable voltages.
Station 24 is shown as an example below.

.. figure:: /images/ctd_hydro_data_acq/stn_24_bad_sensors.*

  Station 24

Stations 29 and 32 (not shown) are other examples of stations with large sections of the profile flagged as questionable.

Pressure Analysis
-----------------

Laboratory calibrations of CTD pressure sensors were performed prior to the cruise.
Dates of laboratory calibration are recorded on the underway sampling package table and calibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.

The lab calibration coefficients provided on the calibration report were used to convert frequencies to pressure.
Initially SIO pressure lab calibration slope and offsets coefficients were applied to cast data.
A shipboard calibration offset was applied to the converted pressures during each cast.
These offsets were determined by the pre and post-cast on-deck pressure offsets.
The pressure offsets were applied per configuration cast sets.

The overall average offset before and after cast was -0.0709 dbar.

Temperature Analysis
--------------------

Laboratory calibrations of temperature sensors were performed prior to the cruise at the SIO Calibration Facility.
Dates of laboratory calibration are recorded on the underway sampling package table and calibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.

The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used to convert SBE3plus frequencies to ITS-90 temperature.
Additional shipboard calibrations were performed to correct sensor bias.
Two independent metrics of calibration accuracy were used to determine sensor bias.
At each bottle closure, the primary and secondary temperature were compared with each other and with a SBE35RT reference temperature sensor.

The SBE35RT Digital Reversing Thermometer is an internally-recording temperature sensor that operates independently of the CTD.
The SBE35RT was located equidistant between the two SBE3plus temperature sensors.
The SBE35RT is triggered by the SBE32 carousel in response to a bottle closure.
According to the manufacturer’s specifications, the typical stability is 0.001°C/year.
The SBE35RT was set to internally average over a 15 second period.

A functioning SBE3plus sensor typically exhibit a consistent predictable well modeled response.
The response model is second order with respect to pressure, a first order with respect to temperature and a first order with respect to time.
The functions used to apply shipboard calibrations are as follows.


.. math::

  T_{cor} = T + D_1 P_2 + D_2 P + D_3 T_2 + D_4 T + \text{Offset}

.. math::

  T_{90} = T + tp_1 P + t_0

.. math::

  T_{90} = T + a P_2 + b P + c T_2 + d T + \text{Offset}

Corrected temperature differences are shown in the following figures.

The 95% confidence limits for the mean low-gradient (values -0.002°C :math:`\leq` T1-T2 :math:`\leq` 0.002°C) differences are ±0.0068°C for SBE35RT-T1, ±0.0067°C for SBE35RT-T2 and ±0.0052°C for T1-T2.
The 95% confidence limits for the deep temperature residuals (where pressure :math:`\geq` 2000dbar) are ±0.00096°C for SBE35RT-T1, ±0.0020°C for SBE35RT-T2 and ±0.0018°C for T1-T2.

Minor complications impacted the temperature sensor data used for the I06S cruise.
  * The SBE35RT sensor data was not available for stations 30 to 34 due to the SBE35RT not being installed.
  * The SBE35RT sensor memory was partially full, and there are partial data reported for cast on station 9.
  * Early stations and station with bad weather had bottles fired on the fly, leading to some SBE35RT averaging periods outside of the intended depth.

The resulting affected sections of data have been coded and documented in the quality code APPENDIX.

Conductivity Analysis
---------------------

Laboratory calibrations of conductivity sensors were performed prior to the cruise at the SeaBird Calibration Facility.
Dates of laboratory calibration are recorded on the underway sampling package table and calibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.

The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used to convert SBE4C frequencies to mS/cm conductivity values.
Additional ship-board calibrations were performed to correct sensor bias.
Corrections for both pressure and temperature sensors were finalized before analyzing conductivity differences.
Two independent metrics of calibration accuracy were examined.
At each bottle closure, the primary and secondary conductivity were compared with each other.
Each sensor was also compared to conductivity calculated from check sample salinities using CTD pressure and temperature.

The differences between primary and secondary temperature sensors were used as filtering criteria to reduce the contamination of conductivity comparisons by package wake.
The coherence of this relationship is shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: images/ctd_hydro_data_acq/c_t_coherence_p.*

A functioning SBE4C sensor typically exhibit a predictable modeled response.
Offsets for each C sensor were determined using C\ :sub:`Bottle` - C\ :sub:`CTD` differences in a deeper pressure range (500 or more dbars).
After conductivity offsets were applied to all casts, response to pressure, temperature and conductivity were examined for each conductivity sensor.
The response model is second order with respect to pressure, second order with respect to temperature, second order with respect to conductivity and a first order with respect to time.
The functions used to apply shipboard calibrations are as follows.

Corrections made to all conductivity sensors are of the form:

.. math::

  C_{cor} = C + cp_2 P^2 + cp_1 P + ct_2 T^2 + ct_1 T + cc_2 C^2 + cc_1 C + \text{Offset}

Salinity residuals after applying shipboard P/T/C corrections are summarized in the following figures.
Only CTD and bottle salinity data with "acceptable" quality codes are included in the differences.
Quality codes and comments are published in the APPENDIX of this report.

  Salinity residuals by pressure.

  Deep Salinity residuals by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).

The 95% confidence limits for the mean low-gradient (values -0.002 mPSU :math:`\leq` T1-T2 :math:`\leq` 0.002 mPSU) differences are ±0.0538 mPSU for salinity-C1SAL.
The 95% confidence limits for the deep salinity residuals (where pressure :math:`\geq` 2000dbar) are ±0.0317 mPSU for salinity-C1SAL.

A number of issues affected conductivity and calculated CTD salinities during this cruise.
  * Primary conductivity sensor (S/N: 2569) failed shortly after the bottom of cast 116/01. Inspection after recovery showed goo inside the cell.
  * Bottle salinity analysis was complicated due to problems with the two Autosals, leading to knock-on problems when attempting to calibrate conductivity against bottle salinity.
  * Salinity lab temperatures were unstable during the time of analysis for stations 134-142. Further details on lab temperature complications are outlined in the Salinity section of this report.
  * Early stations and station with bad weather had bottles fired on the fly.

The resulting affected sections of data have been coded and documented in the quality code APPENDIX.

CTD Dissolved Oxygen
--------------------

Laboratory calibrations of the dissolved oxygen sensors were performed prior to the cruise at the SBE calibration facility.
Dates of laboratory calibration are recorded on the underway sampling package table and calibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.

The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used to convert SBE43 frequencies to µmol/kg oxygen values for acquisition only.
Additional shipboard fitting were performed to correct for the sensors non-linear response.
Corrections for pressure, temperature and conductivity sensors were finalized before analyzing dissolved oxygen data.
The SBE43 sensor data were compared to dissolved |O2| check samples taken at bottle stops by matching the down cast CTD data to the up cast trip locations along isopycnal surfaces.
CTD dissolved |O2| was then calculated using Clark Cell MPOD |O2| sensor response model for Beckman/SensorMedics and SBE43 dissolved |O2| sensors.
The residual differences of bottle check value versus CTD dissolved |O2| values are minimized by optimizing the SIO DO sensor response model coefficients with a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares fitting procedure.

The general form of the SIO DO sensor response model equation for Clark cells follows Brown and Morrison [Mill82]_ and Owens [Owen85]_ SIO models DO sensor secondary responses with lagged CTD data.
In-situ pressure and temperature are filtered to match the sensor responses.
Time constants for the pressure response (:math:`\tau_p`), a slow :math:`\tau_{Tf}` and fast :math:`\tau_{Ts}` thermal response, package velocity :math:`\tau_{dP}`, thermal diffusion :math:`\tau_{dT}` and pressure hysteresis :math:`\tau_h` are fitting parameters.
Once determined for a given sensor, these time constants typically remain constant for a cruise.
The thermal diffusion term is derived by low-pass filtering the difference between the fast response T\ :sub:`s` and slow response T\ :sub:`l` temperatures.
This term is intended to correct non-linearity in sensor response introduced by inappropriate analog thermal compensation.
Package velocity is approximated by low-pass filtering 1st-order pressure differences, and is intended to correct flow-dependent response.
Dissolved |O2| concentration is then calculated:


.. math::

  O_2 \text{ml/l} = \left[ C_1 \cdot V_{\text{DO}} \cdot e^{C_2 \frac{P_h}{5000}} + C_3 \right] \cdot f_{\text{sat}}(T,P) \cdot e^{\left( C_4 t_l + C_5 t_s + C_7 P_l + C_6 \frac{dO_c}{dT} + C_8 \frac{dP}{dTt} + C_9 dT \right)}

Where:

- |O2| ml/l Dissolved |O2| concentration in ml/l
- V\ :sub:`DO`  Raw sensor output
- C\ :sub:`1` Sensor slope
- C\ :sub:`2` Hysteresis ronse coefficient
- C\ :sub:`3` Sensor offset
- f\ :sub:`sat` ( T , P )|O2| saturation at T,P (ml/l)
- T In-situ temperature (°C)
- P In-situ pressure (decibars)
- P\ :sub:`h` Low-pass filtered hysteresis pressure (decibars)
- T\ :sub:`l` Long-ronse low-pass filtered temperature (°C)
- T\ :sub:`s` Short-ronse low-pass filtered temperature (°C)
- P\ :sub:`l` Low-pass filtered pressure (decibars)
- dO\ :sub:`c` / dt Sensor current gradient (µamps/sec)
- dP/dt Filtered package velocity (db/sec)
- dT Low-pass filtered thermal diffusion estimate (T\ :sub:`s` - T\ :sub:`l`)
- C\ :sub:`4` - C\ :sub:`9` Ronse coefficients

CTD dissolved |O2| residuals are shown in the following figures :ref:`Oxy-lograd` through :ref:`Oxy-deep`.

.. _Oxy-lograd:

.. figure:: images/ctd_hydro_data_acq/btl_oxy_stn.*

.. _Oxy-deep:

.. figure:: images/ctd_hydro_data_acq/btl_oxy_stn_deep.*

  Deep |O2| residuals by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).

The standard deviations of 4.78 (µmol/kg) for all dissolved oxygen bottle data values and 2.12 (µmol/kg) for deep dissolved oxygen values are only presented as general indicators of the goodness of fit.
CLIVAR GO-SHIP standards for CTD dissolved oxygen data are < 1% accuracy against on board Winkler titrated dissolved |O2| lab measurements.

A number of complications arose with the acquisition and processing of CTD dissolved oxygen data.
  * All SBE43 sensors used exhibited unusual amounts of noise and spikes throughout the cruise due to electrical problems


All compromised data signals were recorded and coded in the data files.
The bottle trip levels affected by the signals were coded and are included in the bottle data comments section of the APPENDIX.
