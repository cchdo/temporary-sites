Equipment and Techniques
------------------------
Two Guildline Autosals located in salinity analysis room, an 8400B (S/N 69-180) and an 8400A (S/N 57-526), were used for all salinity measurements.
The salinity analysis room for I06S was located in the Climate Controlled Chamber, a refrigerator port and amidships between the Computer Lab and Bioanalytical Lab.
Both were serviced prior to TGT366/I06S in San Diego and sent with other equipment in January.
The salinometer readings were logged on a computer using a LabView program developed by Carl Mattson.
The Autosal water bath temperature was set to 21°C. The laboratory’s temperature was set and maintained to 20°C.
This is to ensure stabilize reading values and improve accuracy.
Salinity analyses were performed after samples had equilibrated to laboratory temperature range of 20-21°C, usually 8 hours after collection.
The salinometer was standardized for each group of samples analyzed (1 or 2 casts, up to 72 samples) using two bottles of standard seawater: one at the beginning and end of each set of measurements.
The salinometer output was logged to a computer file.
The software prompted the analyst to flush the instrument’s cell and change samples when appropriate.
Between runs the water from the last standard was left in the cell. For each calibration standard, the salinometer cell was initially flushed 2 times before a set of conductivity ratio reading was taken.
For each sample, the salinometer cell was initially flushed at least 2 times before a set of conductivity ratio readings were taken.

IAPSO Standard Seawater Batch P-162 was used to standardize all casts.

Sampling and Data Processing
----------------------------
The salinity samples were collected in 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate bottles that had been rinsed at least three times with sample water prior to filling.
The bottles were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene screw caps.
This assembly provides very low container dissolution and sample evaporation.
Prior to sample collection, inserts were inspected for proper fit and loose inserts replaced to insure an airtight seal.
Laboratory temperature was also monitored electronically throughout the cruise.
PSS-78 salinity [UNESCO1981]_ was calculated for each sample from the measured conductivity ratios.
The offset between the initial standard seawater value and its reference value was applied to each sample.
Then the difference (if any) between the initial and final vials of standard seawater was applied to each sample as a linear function of elapsed run time.
The corrected salinity data was then incorporated into the cruise database.

Narrative
---------
Autosal 69-180 was used to process samples from the test cast, underway, and the first two stations.
Communication errors between Labview and Autosal 69-180 occurred during processing of samples, causing the Labview software to lose connection with the Autosal.
The issue was tracked down to the serial-to-USB converter, which had its buffer settings set lower than expected.
Once the buffer value was fixed, the problem appeared to disappear.
A red fleck was found in the cell before the running of samples from station 3.
The fleck is suspected to be from red paint, or from the red rubber stopper used to fill the top of the bottle.
Autosals were subsequently switched from 69-180 to 57-526.
Autosal 57-526 was used from station 3 to 55, with its most notable problem being water being stuck in the manifold, causing problems of sections of the cell not filling with water.
This water had to be cleared out multiple times during the cruise.
At one point after clearing the manifold of water the standard number drifted by 40 units.
After much head scratching and waiting it went back to the previous standard range a few hours later.
Autosal 57-526, being a model 8400A, appeared to be more unstable with its standard numbers between runs.

1882 salinity samples were taken. 1 sample was lost during measurement due to sampler error.
One bottle was broken during sampling.
