The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface ocean was measured throughout the duration of this expedition with a General Oceanics 8050 underway system. Uncontaminated seawater was continuously passed (~2.8 l/min) through a chamber where the seawater concentration of dissolved CO2 was equilibrated with an overlying headspace gas. The CO2 mole fraction of this headspace gas (xCO2) was measured approximately every three minutes via a non-dispersive infrared analyzer (Licor 7000). Roughly every three hours, the system measured four gas standards with known CO2 concentrations certified by the NOAA Earth Science Research Laboratory in Boulder, CO ranging from ~300 – 900 ppm CO2. Additionally, a tank of 99.9995% ultra-high purity nitrogen gas was measured as a baseline 0% CO2 standard. Following measurements of standard gases, six measurements of atmospheric pCO2 were made of air supplied through tubing fastened to the ships starboard jackstaff. Twice a day, the infrared analyzer was calibrated via a zero and span routine using the nitrogen gas and the highest concentration (872.6 ppm) CO2 standard. In addition to measurements of seawater xCO2, atmospheric xCO2, and standard gases, several variables were monitored to evaluate system performance (e.g. gas and water flow rates, pump speeds, etc). For more detail on the general design of this underway pCO2 system, see Pierrot et. al (2009).
A Seabird (SBE) 38 temperature sensor located at the ship’s seawater intake provided measurements of in situ seawater temperature, while a SBE 45 thermosalinograph monitored temperature and salinity in the bow of the ship before the seawater reached the pCO2 system. An Aanderaa 4330 optode plumbed in line with the pCO2 system water supply measured dissolved oxygen (DO) continuously. Additionally, a modified SeaFET system was also plumbed in line which measured pH throughout the duration of the cruise.

During the transit from Cape Town to the continental shelf of Antarctica and the excursion to Port Elizabeth, discrete samples (n=73) for measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, DO, nutrients (nitrate, nitrate, silica, phosphate), and salinity were drawn from the ships uncontaminated seawater supply every four hours. These were analyzed onboard and will be used for comparison to measurements collected by the underway system.
A preliminary round of processing was performed on this dataset using Matlab routines developed by Denis Pierrot of the Atlantic Oceanic and Meteorological Lab in Miami, FL. pH was calculated from recorded voltages using the Matlab scripts provided as supplementary material in Bresnahan et. al (2014). Of 15,744 measurements, 627 were assigned a WOCE quality flag of 4 (bad measurement), while 72 were assigned a quality flag of 3 (questionable measurement). Measurements of gas standards were within 1% of their certified value throughout the duration of the expedition (Figure 1).

Preliminary review of collected data suggest that the main control on the surface seawater carbonate system was temperature (Figure 2). Excursions from thermodynamic controls on pCO2, pH and DO were measured during the brief times spent on the continental shelf near the coast of South Africa, where higher rates of organic matter remineralization may have been contributed to increases in pCO2 and decreases in pH and DO. However, further evaluation of these data and the supplementary suite of discrete measurements that were collected is needed before the controls on pCO2, pH and DO can be fully elucidated. In two brief instances, the underway system was stopped due to problems with seawater supply that were encountered on account of extremely rough weather.
This dataset should be considered preliminary; additional quality control and quality assurance is needed before these data can be considered final.
